### Overview
---
The primary goal of this analysis report is to gain insights into customer behaviour regarding their subscription patterns and the associated revenue generated for the services arm of company XYZ. 

### Tools and Technologies
---
1. Microsft excel: for data storage, cleaning and integration.
2. Microsoft SQL Server: for indept analysis of the data provided.
3. Microsoft Power Bi: for data visualization and reporting.

### Objectives
---
The goals/objectives of this report is to:
1. **Identify key metrics such as:**
   - **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):** Measures the total revenue a customer genetrates over the period of 2 years as provided in the dataset.
   - **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Cost of acquiring a new customer.
   - **Churn Rate:** Percentage of customers who stop subscribing within a specific period.
   - **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Total recurring revenue generated each month.**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** Average revenue generated per user.
2. **Analyze subscription patterns:**
   - **Subscription Length:** How long customers typically stay subscribed.
   - **Upgrade/Downgrade Frequency:** How often customers change their subscription plans.
   - **Payment Patterns:** How customers pay (e.g monthly, annually).
4. **Identify revenue trends:**

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
---
The dataset (as seen in the exerpts above) was cleaned and prepared using Microsoft Excel and certain formulas were employed to calculate 
1. average subscription duration and
2. to identify the most subscription type as shown below.

```
1. =AVERAGEIF(D:D, D2, L:L) 

2. =COUNTIF(D:D, D2)
where D:D represents the column which contains the data for suscription types and L:L represents the calculated column containing subscription duration.
```

Below are screenshots showing the results for average subscription duration and the identification of the the most popular subscription type using excel formulas and also pivot tables.
